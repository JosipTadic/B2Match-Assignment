## Goal of this assignment was to fetch data from some of the public API's and render them in list or table. Clicking an item should render a clicked item with more info.
### Technologies used: HTML, CSS, React/TypeScript (+React-router-dom), Bootstrap 5
 Everything is functioning as it should, but project should use more decompositions of components, and better styling practices, I am aware of that but i was limited by the time :)
